    Parameters handling:
        !!!! This program is intended to be used with binarized images. The 
        supported formats are tif, png, bmp, pgm. The jpg/jpeg format does not 
        work. Other formats have not been tested.
        For grayscale and RGB/RGBA images, you may encounter some troubles. The 
        best way to deal with this is to convert the images (with ImageJ for 
        example) before loading them for the vectorisation. Otherwise, use the 
        'verbose, 'debug', 'plot' and 'save_distance_map' options to see what 
        went wrong and try to correct it.

    Initializes parameters.
    
    # General parameters
    
    source_path str : absolute path of the file/directory to vectorize.
        If 'source_path' is a directory, the program will process sequentially 
        all the images contained in this directory. If it's a file, it will 
        only process this one file. The images must be binarized 8-bit images. 
        
    dest_path str: absolute path of the directory in which to save the 
        results (gpickle files, graph images...). If it doesn't exist, it will
        be created at runtime.
        
    unstack bool: if enabled, the program will save every slice of the 
        tif stacks encountered in [dest_path]/unstacked_slices/. If this 
        directory does not exist, it will be created at runtime. The slices 
        will be name like this: stackname_slicenumber.png.The slice number is 
        left padded with 0 to ease later processing.
        
    verbose bool: verbosity switch. If set to True, the program will 
        then print its current processing step as  well as the time it needed 
        for the last step. For some steps (usually the ones that take longer) 
        information about the current state of the program is given in more 
        detail to be able to trace the program's progress.
        
    debug bool: debugging switch. If set to True, turns on additional 
        debug output. Also saves additional visualizations of the processing 
        like a plot of the contours and the triangulation. May consume a 
        considerable additional amount of time because the additional figures 
        take quite long to plot and save.
        
    invert bool: inverts the images. Must be switched on if background 
        pixels are white (255). Otherwise in case of empty slices they won't be 
        detected causing the program to crash.
    
    
    # Other parameters
    
    pruning int: pruning threshold. Branches shorter than the threshold 
        specified with pruning will be removed from the network. This is done 
        to reduce the number of surplus branches due to noisy contours of the 
        network. Defaults to 5 which has proven to be a reasonable number of 
        nodes to prune away.
        
    redundancy int: when redundancy = 0, a graph-object with no 
        redundant nodes (i.e. nodes with degree 2) will be saved.
        When redundancy = 1, a graph-object with half the redundant nodes as 
        well as one without redundant nodes will be saved.
        When redundancy = 2, a graph-object with all redundant nodes as well as
        one with half the redundant nodes and one with no redundant nodes will 
        be saved.    
        
    smoothing bool: if enabled, the binary image will be smoothed using 
        binary opening and closing operations. The kernel size of said
        operations can be controlled by passing an integer as parameter. 
        The right kernel size is highly dependant on the resolution of the 
        image. As a rule of thumb choose a kernel size below the width of the 
        smallest feature in the image (in pixels).
        
    plot bool: enables visualization (plotting) of the created graphs.
        The visualization is done using matplotlib and in general gets very
        slow when dealing with large networks. As a rule of thumb it is 
        encouraged to only plot networks when they contain fewer than 10^5
        nodes. The format the plot will be saved in as well as its resolution
        (if not saved as vector graphic) must be specified using the 
        'figure_format' and 'dpi' parameters. If you want to visualize really 
        large networks, saving them as .png with a high dpi (>2000 so features 
        are still recognizeable) might work.
        
    figure_format str: sets the output format of plots (networks or 
        debugging plots) to the desired format. Supported formats include: pdf, 
        png, jpg, tif (look at matplotlib's safefig-function for a complete 
        list). In general if the plot is needed for a report/publication, pdf 
        is recommended as they can easily be modified and beautified using a
        vector graphics editor. Saving as pdf is relatively time-inefficient.
        If one wants to visualize large plots, I would recommend saving them
        as png with a high resolution (use 'dpi' parameter to crank up 
        resolution). This saves time and yields acceptable results.
        
    graph_format str: sets the output format of graphs to the desired 
        format. Supported formats are [gpickle, adjlist, gml, graphml, yaml,
        edgelist, weighted_edgelist, multiline_adjlist, gexf, pajek]. Have a 
        look at the different networkx.write_ ... functions for an in detail 
        explanation. Only the gpickle output has been tested in Python 3.7.
        
    dpi int: sets the resolution (dots per inch) for plots (networks or 
        debugging plots). High resolutions take longer to save and create 
        larger image files. Low resolutions sometimes make it hard to recognize 
        smaller details in networks.
        
    node_size int: controls the size of the nodes displayed in graph
        visualization. If node_size = 0, only edges and no nodes are plotted.
        
    save_distance_map bool: enables saving of the euclidean distance map 
        created during the network extraction process.
